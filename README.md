# Rust GTK Calculator

A simple calculator application built with **Rust** and **GTK 3** for the graphical user interface (GUI). This project demonstrates how to use the Rust programming language and GTK 3 to create desktop applications with a clean and user-friendly interface.

---

## Features

- Basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- A clean and responsive user interface using **GTK Grid**.
- Customizable window size using a configuration file (`config.cfg`).
- Menu button on the title bar with the following actions:
  - Preferences (future implementation)
  - About dialog with program details.

## Requirements

- **Rust** (version `1.80+`)
- **GTK 3** runtime environment
- **Cargo** (Rust's package manager)

---

## Installation and Running

### Step 1: Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/haiphamcoder/rust-gtk-calculator.git
cd rust-gtk-calculator
```

### Step 2: Install dependencies

Make sure you have the GTK 3 development libraries installed on your system:

- On **Ubuntu/Debian**:

  ```bash
  sudo apt update
  sudo apt install libgtk-3-dev
  ```

- On **Fedora**:

  ```bash
  sudo dnf install gtk3-devel
  ```

- On **Windows** or **MacOS**, refer to the [GTK Installation Guide](https://gtk.org/docs/installations).

### Step 3: Build and run the project

```bash
cargo build
cargo run
```

---

## Configuration

The application uses a `config.cfg` file to set the default window size. Create or edit the `config.cfg` file in the root directory with the following format:

```cfg
width=400
height=600
```

You can adjust the `width` and `height` values according to your preference.

## Key Files and Modules

- **`src/main.rs`**:
  Initializes and runs the application.
  
- **`src/app.rs`**:
  Contains the core logic of the calculator, menu, and dialog management.

- **`src/config.rs`**:
  Parses the `config.cfg` file to set the default application settings.

## Future Improvements

- Add advanced operations (e.g., square root, power, etc.).
- Implement a history panel to show past calculations.
- Add support for saving and loading configurations.
- Improve theme and styling.
